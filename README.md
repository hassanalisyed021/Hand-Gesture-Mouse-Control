# Hand Gesture Mouse Control

This project allows you to control your computer mouse using hand gestures via a webcam. It utilizes **OpenCV, MediaPipe (via HandTrackingModule), and PyAutoGUI** to detect hand movements and perform mouse actions like moving, clicking, right-clicking, and even taking screenshots.

## üöÄ Features

- **Hand Tracking**: Uses a custom HandTrackingModule to detect hands.
- **Mouse Movement**: Move the cursor by moving your index finger.
- **Clicking Actions**:
  - Index finger up ‚Üí Move cursor

  - Three fingers up ‚Üí Right click

- **Screenshot Capture**: Raise all five fingers to trigger a screenshot.

- **Optimized for Performance**:
  - Uses smoothing for smoother mouse movement.
  - Introduces click delay to avoid unintended multiple clicks.

## üì¶ Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pyautogui mediapipe
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hassanalisyed021/Hand-Gesture-Mouse-Control.git
cd hand-gesture-mouse
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Script

```bash
python hand_mouse_control.py
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Ensure your webcam is working.
3. Move your hand within the webcam frame to control the mouse.
4. Use different gestures to trigger actions (listed above).
5. Press `Q` to exit.

## üîß Troubleshooting

- If the cursor movement is **laggy**, ensure no unnecessary background processes are running.
- If gestures are **not detected properly**, adjust your hand position or lighting.
- If the camera **does not open**, ensure that your webcam is working and accessible.

## üìå Future Improvements

- Add gestures for **scrolling** and **dragging**.
- Improve multi-hand support for **dual-hand actions**.
- Integrate **voice commands** for additional control.
