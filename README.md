# Hand-Gesture-Mouse-Control
This project allows you to control your computer mouse using hand gestures via a webcam. It utilizes OpenCV, MediaPipe (via HandTrackingModule), and PyAutoGUI to detect hand movements and perform mouse actions like moving, clicking, right-clicking, and even taking screenshots.
